# Casino version of WAR game.

Idea is to create simple version of card WAR game that is mostly being used by casino players.

1. When program runs user should decide which version of game he wants to play, Regular WAR where biggest card wins or opposite WAR where lowest card wins.
1. After version was chosen, game should generate deck of cards in random order.
1. Player and Computer will be given one card each.
1. After cards have been dealt to both players, 3 seconds countdown will start after which cards of player and computer will be
seen and winner of a round will be announced.
1. After round system will needs to ask if you would like to continue the game? Game continues until player or computer reaches 5 wins.
1. Corner cases such as ties, CTRL+D needs to be secured.
